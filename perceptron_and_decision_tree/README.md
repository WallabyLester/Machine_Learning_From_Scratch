# Perceptrons and Decision Trees

In this assignment:
- Understand and implement evaluation measures for machine learning algorithms
- Implement information gain and entropy measures
- Implement a perceptron classifier
- Implement a prior probability classifier
- Implement a decision tree with the ID3 algorithm
- Compare and contrast machine learning approaches on different datasets

## Running the test cases

The test cases can be run with:

``python -m pytest -s``

at the root directory of the assignment repository.
