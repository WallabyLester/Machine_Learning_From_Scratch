# Naive Bayes and Expectation Maximization

In this assignment:
- Implement Naive Bayes for fully-labeled data
- Implement Naive Bayes for partially-labeled data using the expectation maximization algorithm
- Use your trained model to analyze a dataset of political speeches

## Running the test cases

The test cases can be run from the root directory of the repository with:

``python -m pytest -s``
