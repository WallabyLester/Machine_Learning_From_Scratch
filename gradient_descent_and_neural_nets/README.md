# Gradient Descent and Neural Networks

In this assignment:
- Implement Lp-norm regularization
- Implement two types of loss functions
- Do experiments to understand gradient descent, loss landscapes, and regularization.

## Running the test cases

The test cases can be run with:

``python -m pytest -s``

at the root directory of the assignment repository.
